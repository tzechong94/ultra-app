### FAQs
__1. I have feedback/ideas for the app. How can I tell you?__ 
- You can contact me via email tze.chong1994@gmail.com

__2. Why can't I do shorter/longer projects? (why 1 to 12 months?)__
- Ultra was designed for people embarking on relatively harder goals/projects so they could learn consistency and find joy in working in consistent work towards their goals. I assumed it would be fun for people to turn their new year's resolutions into projects so I set 12 months as the limit. If you need more time, create a follow up project!
- Discipline and consistency are the hardest thing I learned, so making it visual and fun might be a way to hack our brain to stick at it.

__3. What other features are in the pipeline?__
Some ideas that I have include:
- Will probably start off with the more basic ones like forgetting password, changing password, social logins, sharing, weekly reminder on push notifications, posting multiple media etc. Sorry i did the more important features first. 
- More tools to measure progress different kinds of projects.
- Was reading about deliberate practice from the researcher who coined the term, and learned that the most efficient way of deliberate practice is to have someone experienced to give weekly tasks outside of your comfort zone, share their mental representation of how they think of the skill, to provide constant feedback, and of course to put in lots of hours into practising. Could an AI plan a detailed roadmap for you, set tasks and give you feedback? Or could this garner more interest to attract experts to coach less experienced individuals? 
- AI generated daily plan and analysis
- Sharing of real life events to help you join a local community, or perhaps things like running races for you to commit to before you embark on your self improvement journey.
- tell me what else you need!

__4. Why can't you document progress on Instagram/Facebook?__
- I tried for this some time, creating a separate account just to post updates, but the lack of like-minded people made it harder to stick at projects. These social media are designed to be addictive, so I ended up being less productive. These solutions also don't have metrics tracking tools that I hope to build in the future.
